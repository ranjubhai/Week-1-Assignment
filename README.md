While doing the project of Summer of Code organised by WNCC, I gained various insights about how useful is python and how it is closely associated with Data Science and Machine Learning.
In the first week, I learnt basics of python and data science libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn. Further I learnt about new python environment called jupyter.
I also learnt functions, operators, recursion, iterators and many other components of python.
2nd week was of assignments. In the third week I learnt ML, supervised learning and unsupervised learning, and technical analysis. I also learnt yfinance library.
